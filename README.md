- A [better interface](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/better-skill-capped) for browsing [skill-capped.com](https://www.skill-capped.com/lol/browse)
- A [BUNCH](https://github.com/shepherdjerred-minecraft) of projects related to the game Minecraft
- An [Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/ansible-playbook) that manages several of my servers
- A [super simple interface](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/ec2-instance-restart-frontend) for stopping/starting EC2 instances
